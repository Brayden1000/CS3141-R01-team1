This describes what to include in the mobileAPI GET header to call certain functions and also what to expect in terms of return values. I also included examples for what the request part of the URL should look like.
Feel free to let me know if I missed anything or if something isn't working.

Name: Login   
  Key: login  
  Value: what ever the email is for the user logging in
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 if not (not successful meaning it was an invalid (non mtu.edu) email)
  Example: mobileAPI.php?login=nathanan@mtu.edu
  
Name: Get Elevator Info
  Key: info
  Value: elevator name (format for elevator id's still in progress), or "all" to get all elevators
  Return: List of elevators and info requested. Will be echoed in the order of ID, # of reports, then location, repeating that for all elevators if "all"
  Example: mobileAPI.php?info=all
  
Name: Is User Admin
  Key: admin
  Value: email of user
  Return: 1 if user is an admin, 0 if not. 
  Example: mobileAPI.php?admin=fakeadmin@mtu.edu
  
Name: Make User Report
  Key: report
  Value: anything
  Params: user email, elevator id, and comment
  Note: the end of the URL will look like mobileAPI.php?report=1&email={}&elevatorID={}&comment={}
  Note: comment can be left blank, removing the "&comment={}" part; also the {}'s indicate that's where you put the value for each respective parameter
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 if not (unsuccessful if email or elevator id not included)
  Example: mobileAPI.php?report=1&email=nathanan@mtu.edu&elevatorID=2&comment=Cannot%20be%20called%20from%20second%20floor
  Note: the %20's are indicitive of spaces, just formatting a normal string into the url should work fine when programming
  
Name: Verify Elevator Down
  Key: verify
  Value: anything
  Params: elevator id, admin's email
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 or -1 if not (0 if email or elevator id not included; -1 if email not an admin email)
  Example: mobileAPI.php?verify=1&elevatorID=2&email=fakeadmin@mtu.edu
  
Name: Get Reports
  Key: viewReports
  Value: elevatorID
  Return: First, the number of reports, followed by that many repetitions of elevator ID, report ID, reporter email, and comment, in that order
