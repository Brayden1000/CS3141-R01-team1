This describes what to include in the mobileAPI GET header to call certain functions and also what to expect in terms of return values.
At the time of typing out all these, I haven't implemented them, so if they aren't working that's likely why. Also feel free to let me know if I missed anything.

Name: Login   
  Key: login  
  Value: what ever the email is for the user logging in
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 if not
  Example: mobileAPI.php?login=nathanan@mtu.edu
  
Name: Get Elevator Info
  Key: info
  Value: elevator name (format for elevator id's still in progress), or "all" to get all elevators
  Return: List of elevators and info requested. Will be echoed in the order of ID, # of reports, then location, repeating that for all elevators if "all"
  Example: mobileAPI.php?info=all
  
Name: Is User Admin
  Key: admin
  Value: email of user
  Return: 1 if user is an admin, 0 if not.
  Example: mobileAPI.php?admin=fakeadmin@mtu.edu
  
Name: Make User Report
  Key: report
  Value: anything
  Params: user email, elevator id, and comment
  Note: the end of the URL will look like mobileAPI.php?report=1&email={}&elevatorID={}&comment={}
  Note: comment can be left blank, removing the "&comment={}" part; also the {}'s indicate that's where you put the value for each respective parameter
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 if not
  Example: mobileAPI.php?report=1&email=nathanan@mtu.edu&elevatorID=2&comment=Cannot%20be%20called%20from%20second%20floor
  Note: the %20's are indicitive of spaces, just formatting a normal string into the url should work fine when programming
  
Name: Verify Elevator Down
  Key: verify
  Value: anything
  Params: elevator id, admin's email
  Return: 1 if successful; 0 if not
  Example: mobileAPI.php?verify=1&elevatorID=2&email=fakeadmin@mtu.edu
  
Name: Get Reports
  Key: viewReports
  Value: elevatorID
  Return: First, the number of reports, followed by that many repetitions of elevator ID, report ID, reporter email, and comment, in that order
